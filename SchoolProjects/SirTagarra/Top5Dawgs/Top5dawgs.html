            The Husky is a medium-sized working dog known 
            for its endurance and striking appearance. 
            Bred by Siberian nomads for sled pulling,
            they are energetic and friendly. Huskies 
            are social dogs that thrive on activity 
            but can be independent and stubborn.

            The Shiba Inu is a small, agile breed of dog
            from Japan, originally bred for hunting in 
            mountainous terrain. Known for their 
            fox-like appearance, they have erect ears,
            a curled tail, and a confident, bold personality.
            Shiba Inus are independent and strong-willed but 
            can be loyal and affectionate with their owners.

            slender build and dignified, calm demeanor. 
            Borzois are independent but affectionate with their 
            families and need space to run.
