The short story about me landing 
to programming was me 
thinking to choose between 
<font color="#6488ea">
    <strong>
    <br> 
   comp prog or comp service
    </font>
</strong>, 
but i did a research about the difference between them on 
<br>
which one is better for stable wealth and has higher potential opportunities.
    <br>
    <br>
finally chose prog because its also part of technology and i like them even i 
    <br>
dont understand them at the first time. and now at the present taking the programming path
    <br>
from senior and through college in the future ofcourse.
